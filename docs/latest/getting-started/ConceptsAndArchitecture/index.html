<h2 id="producers-consumers-topics-and-subscriptions">Producers, consumers, topics, and subscriptions</h2>

<p>Pulsar is built on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">publish-subscribe</a> pattern, aka <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is the publish-subscribe pattern (pub-sub)?" data-placement="top" data-content="TODO" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">pub-sub</span>. In this pattern, <a href="#producers">producers</a> publish messages to <a href="#topics">topics</a>. <a href="#consumers">Consumers</a> can then <a href="#subscription-modes">subscribe</a> to those topics and process incoming messages.</p>

<p>Once a <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a subscription?" data-placement="top" data-content="TODO" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">subscription</span> has been created, all messages will be <a href="#persistent-storage">retained</a> by Pulsar, even if the consumer gets disconnected. Retained messages will be discarded only when a consumer <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is an acknowledgement (ack)?" data-placement="top" data-content="A message sent to a Pulsar broker by a consumer that a message has been successfully processed. An acknowledgement (ack) is Pulsar's way of knowing that the message can be deleted from the system; if no acknowledgement, then the message will be retained until it's processed." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">acknowledges</span> that they’ve been successfully processed.</p>

<h3 id="producers">Producers</h3>

<p>A producer is a process that attaches to a topic and publishes messages to a Pulsar <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a broker?" data-placement="top" data-content="A stateless component of Pulsar clusters that runs two other components: an HTTP server exposing a REST interface for administration and topic lookup and a dispatcher that handles all message transers. Pulsar clusters typically consist of multiple brokers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">broker</span> for processing.</p>

<h4 id="send-modes">Send modes</h4>

<p>Producers can send messages to brokers either synchronously (sync) or asynchronously (async).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Mode</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Sync send</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">The producer will wait for acknowledgement from the broker after sending each message. If acknowledgment isn’t received then the producer will consider the send operation a failure.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Async send</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">The producer will put the message in a blocking queue and return immediately. The client library will then send the message to the broker in the background. If the queue is full (max size <a href="../../reference/Configuration#broker">configurable</a>, the producer could be blocked or fail immediately when calling the API, depending on arguments passed to the producer.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="compression">Compression</h4>

<p>Messages published by producers can be compressed during transportation in order to save bandwidth. Pulsar currently supports two types of compression:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/lz4/lz4">LZ4</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://zlib.net/">ZLIB</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="batching">Batching</h4>

<p>If batching is enabled, the producer will accumulate and send a batch of messages in a single request. Batching size is defined by the maximum number of messages and maximum publish latency.</p>

<h3 id="consumers">Consumers</h3>

<p>A consumer is a process that attaches to a topic via a subscription and then receives messages.</p>

<h4 id="receive-modes">Receive modes</h4>

<p>Messages can be received from <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a broker?" data-placement="top" data-content="A stateless component of Pulsar clusters that runs two other components: an HTTP server exposing a REST interface for administration and topic lookup and a dispatcher that handles all message transers. Pulsar clusters typically consist of multiple brokers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">brokers</span> either synchronously (sync) or asynchronously (async).</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Mode</th>

  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Sync receive</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">A sync receive will be blocked until a message is available.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Async receive</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">An async receive will return immediately with a future value—a <a href="http://www.baeldung.com/java-completablefuture"><code class="highlighter-rouge">CompletableFuture</code></a> in Java, for example—that completes once a new message is available.</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<h4 id="acknowledgement">Acknowledgement</h4>

<p>When a consumer has successfully processed a message, it needs to send an <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is an acknowledgement (ack)?" data-placement="top" data-content="A message sent to a Pulsar broker by a consumer that a message has been successfully processed. An acknowledgement (ack) is Pulsar's way of knowing that the message can be deleted from the system; if no acknowledgement, then the message will be retained until it's processed." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">acknowledgement</span> to the broker so that the broker can discard the message (otherwise it <a href="#persistent-storage">stores</a> the message).</p>

<p>Messages can be acknowledged either one by one or cumulatively. With cumulative acknowledgement, the consumer only needs to acknowledge the last message it received. All messages in the stream up to (and including) the provided message will not be re-delivered to that consumer.</p>

In this interface, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">received</code> method is called whenever a new message is received.</p>

<h3 id="topics">Topics</h3>

<p>As in other pub-sub systems, topics in Pulsar are named channels for transmitting messages from producers to consumers. Topic names are URLs that have a well-defined structure:</p>

<h3 id="subscription-modes">Subscription modes</h3>

<p>A subscription is a named configuration rule that determines how messages are delivered to <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a consumer?" data-placement="top" data-content="A process that establishes a subscription to a Pulsar topic and processes messages published to that topic by producers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">consumers</span>. There are three available subscription modes in Pulsar: <a href="#exclusive">exclusive</a>, <a href="#shared">shared</a>, and <a href="#failover">failover</a>. These modes are illustrated in the figure below.</p>

<p><img src="/incubator-pulsar/img/pulsar_subscriptions.jpg" alt="Subscription Modes" /></p>

<h4 id="exclusive">Exclusive</h4>

<p>In <em>exclusive</em> mode, only a single consumer is allowed to attach to the subscription. If more than one consumer attempts to subscribe to a topic using the same subscription, the consumer receives an error.</p>

<p>In the diagram above, only <strong>Consumer-A</strong> is allowed to consume messages.</p>

<p>Exclusive mode is the default subscription mode.</p>

<h4 id="shared">Shared</h4>

<p>In <em>shared</em> or <em>round robin</em> mode, multiple consumers can attach to the same subscription. Messages are delivered in a round robin distribution across consumers, and any given message is delivered to only one consumer. When a consumer disconnects, all the messages that were sent to it and not acknowledged will be rescheduled for sending to the remaining consumers.</p>

<p>In the diagram above, <strong>Consumer-B-1</strong> and <strong>Consumer-B-2</strong> are able to subscribe to the topic, but <strong>Consumer-C-1</strong> and others could as well.</p>

<div class="admonition">
  <div class="warning">
    <span class="admonition-title"><p>Limitations of shared mode</p>
</span>
    <p>There are two important things to be aware of when using shared mode:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Message ordering is not guaranteed.</li>
  <li>You cannot use <a href="#acknowledgement">cumulative acknowledgment</a> with shared mode.</li>
</ol>

  </div>
</div>

<h4 id="failover">Failover</h4>

<p>In <em>failover</em> mode, multiple consumers can attach to the same subscription. The consumers will be lexically sorted by the consumer’s name and the first consumer will initially be the only one receiving messages. This consumer is called the <em>master consumer</em>.</p>

<p>When the master consumer disconnects, all (non-acked and subsequent) messages will be delivered to the next consumer in line.</p>

<p>In the diagram above, Consumer-C-1 is the master consumer while Consumer-C-2 would be the next in line to receive messages if Consumer-C-2 disconnected.</p>

<h3 id="partitioned-topics">Partitioned topics</h3>

<p>Normal topics can be served only by a single <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a broker?" data-placement="top" data-content="A stateless component of Pulsar clusters that runs two other components: an HTTP server exposing a REST interface for administration and topic lookup and a dispatcher that handles all message transers. Pulsar clusters typically consist of multiple brokers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">broker</span>, which limits the topic’s maximum throughput. <em>Partitioned topics</em> are a special type of topic that can span multiple brokers and thus allow for much higher throughput.</p>

<p>Behind the scenes, a partitioned topic is actually implemented as N internal topics, where N is the number of partitions. There is no difference between partitioned topics and other normal topics in terms of how subscription modes work.</p>

<p>Partitioned topics need to be explicitly created via the <a href="../../admin/AdminInterface">admin API</a>. The number of partitions can be specified when creating the topic.</p>

<p>The diagram below illustrates this:</p>

<p><img src="/incubator-pulsar/img/pulsar_partitioned_topic.jpg" alt="Partitioned Topic" /></p>

<p>With partitioned topics, the <em>routing mode</em> determines which partition—that is, which internal topic—a message will be published to. There are three routing modes available by default:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left">Mode</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Description</th>
      <th style="text-align: left">Ordering guarantee</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Key hash</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">If a key property has been specified on the message, the partitioned producer will hash the key and assign it to a particular partition.</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Per-key-bucket ordering</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Single default partition</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">If no message is provided, each producer’s message will be routed to a dedicated partition, initially random selected</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Per-producer ordering</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left">Round robin distribution</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">If no message is provided, all messages will be routed to different partitions in round-robin fashion to achieve maximum throughput.</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">None</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>In addition to these default modes, you can also create a custom routing mode if you’re using the <a href="../../applications/JavaClient">Java client</a> by implementing the <a target="_blank" href="/api/client/com/yahoo/pulsar/client/api/MessageRouter.html"><code class="highlighter-rouge">MessageRouter</code></a> interface.</p>

<ul>
  <li>An HTTP server that exposes a REST API for both <a href="../../reference/RestApi">administrative tasks</a> and <a href="#client-setup-phase">topic lookup</a> for producers and consumers</li>

<p>Messages are typically dispatched out of a <a href="#managed-ledger">managed ledger</a> cache for the sake of performance, <em>unless</em> the backlog exceeds the cache size.

<p>Pulsar uses <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/">Apache Zookeeper</a> for metadata storage, cluster configuration, and coordination. In a Pulsar instance:</p>

  <li>Each cluster has its own local ZooKeeper ensemble that stores <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a cluster?" data-placement="top" data-content="A set of Pulsar brokers and BookKeeper servers (aka bookies).

</ul>

<h2 id="persistent-storage">Persistent storage</h2>

<p><img src="/incubator-pulsar/img/broker-bookie.png" alt="Brokers and bookies" /></p>

<p>Pulsar provides guaranteed message delivery for applications. If a message successfully reaches a Pulsar <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a broker?" data-placement="top" data-content="A stateless component of Pulsar clusters that runs two other components: an HTTP server exposing a REST interface for administration and topic lookup and a dispatcher that handles all message transers. Pulsar clusters typically consist of multiple brokers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">broker</span>, it will be delivered to its intended target.</p>

<p>This guarantee requires that non-<span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is an acknowledgement (ack)?" data-placement="top" data-content="A message sent to a Pulsar broker by a consumer that a message has been successfully processed. An acknowledgement (ack) is Pulsar's way of knowing that the message can be deleted from the system; if no acknowledgement, then the message will be retained until it's processed." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">acknowledged</span> messages are stored in a durable manner until they can be delivered to and acknowledged by <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a consumer?" data-placement="top" data-content="A process that establishes a subscription to a Pulsar topic and processes messages published to that topic by producers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">consumers</span>. This mode of messaging is commonly called <em>persistent messaging</em>. In Pulsar, N copies of all messages are stored and synced on disk, for example 4 copies across two servers with mirrored <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID">RAID</a> volumes on each server.</p>

<p>Pulsar uses a system called <a href="http://bookkeeper.apache.org/">Apache BookKeeper</a> for persistent message storage. BookKeeper is a distributed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Write-ahead_logging">write-ahead log</a> (WAL) system that provides a number of crucial advantages for Pulsar:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It enables Pulsar to utilize many independent logs, called <a href="#ledgers">ledgers</a>. Multiple ledgers can be created for <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a topic?" data-placement="top" data-content="A named channel used to pass messages published by producers to consumers who process those messages." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">topics</span> over time.</li>
  <li>It offers very efficient storage for sequential data that handles entry replication.</li>
  <li>It guarantees read consistency of ledgers in the presence of various system failures.</li>
  <li>It offers even distribution of I/O across bookies.</li>
  <li>It’s horizontally scalable in both capacity and throughput. Capacity can be immediately increased by adding more <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a bookie?" data-placement="top" data-content="Bookie is just a nickname for an individual BookKeeper server." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">bookies</span> to a cluster.</li>
  <li><span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a bookie?" data-placement="top" data-content="Bookie is just a nickname for an individual BookKeeper server." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">Bookies</span> are designed to handle thousands of ledgers with concurrent reads and writes. By using multiple disk devices—one for journal and another for general storage–bookies are able to isolate the effects of read operations from the latency of ongoing write operations.</li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to message data, <em>cursors</em> are also persistently stored in BookKeeper. Cursors are <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a subscription?" data-placement="top" data-content="TODO" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">subscription</span> positions for <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a consumer?" data-placement="top" data-content="A process that establishes a subscription to a Pulsar topic and processes messages published to that topic by producers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">consumers</span>. BookKeeper enables Pulsar to store consumer position in a scalable fashion.</p>

<p>At the moment, Pulsar only supports persistent message storage. This accounts for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">persistent</code> in all <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a topic?" data-placement="top" data-content="A named channel used to pass messages published by producers to consumers who process those messages." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">topic</span> names. Here’s an example:</p>

</section>

<p>In the future, Pulsar will support ephemeral message storage.</p>

<h3 id="ledgers">Ledgers</h3>

<p>A <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a ledger?" data-placement="top" data-content="TODO" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">ledger</span> is an append-only data structure with a single writer that is assigned to multiple BookKeeper storage nodes, or <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a bookie?" data-placement="top" data-content="Bookie is just a nickname for an individual BookKeeper server." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">bookies</span>. Ledger entries are replicated to multiple bookies. Ledgers themselves have very simple semantics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A Pulsar broker can create a ledger, append entries to the ledger, and close the ledger.</li>
  <li>After the ledger has been closed—either explicitly or because the writer process crashed—it can then be opened only in read-only mode.</li>
  <li>Finally, when entries in the ledger are no longer needed, the whole ledger can be deleted from the system (across all bookies).</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="ledger-read-consistency">Ledger read consistency</h4>

<p>The main strength of Bookkeeper is that it guarantees read consistency in ledgers in the presence of failures. Since the ledger can only be written to by a single process, that process is free to append entries very efficiently, without need to obtain consensus. After a failure, the ledger will go through a recovery process that will finalize the state of the ledger and establish which entry was last committed to the log. After that point, all readers of the ledger are guaranteed to see the exact same content.</p>

<h4 id="managed-ledgers">Managed ledgers</h4>

<p>Given that Bookkeeper ledgers provide a single log abstraction, a library was developed on top of the ledger called the <em>managed ledger</em> that represents the storage layer for a single topic. A managed ledger represents the abstraction of a stream of messages with a single writer that keeps appending at the end of the stream and multiple <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a cursor?" data-placement="top" data-content="The subscription position for a consumer." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">cursors</span> that are consuming the stream, each with its own associated position.</p>

<p>Internally, a single managed ledger uses multiple BookKeeper ledgers to store the data. There are two reasons to have multiple ledgers:</p>

<ol>
  <li>After a failure, a ledger is no longer writable and a new one needs to be created.</li>
  <li>A ledger can be deleted when all cursors have consumed the messages it contains. This allows for periodic rollover of ledgers.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="journal-storage">Journal storage</h3>

<p>In BookKeeper, <em>journal</em> files contain BookKeeper transaction logs. Before making an update to a <a href="#ledgers">ledger</a></p>

<h3 id="non-persistent-storage">Non-persistent storage</h3>

<p>A future version of BookKeeper will support <em>non-persistent messaging</em> and thus multiple durability modes at the topic level. This will enable you to set the durability mode at the topic level, replacing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">persistent</code> in topic names with a <code class="highlighter-rouge">non-persistent</code> indicator.</p>

<h2 id="replication">Replication</h2>

<p>Pulsar enables messages to be produced and consumed in different geo-locations. For instance, your application may be publishing data in one region or market and you would like to process it for consumption in other regions or markets. <a href="../../admin/GeoReplication">Geo-replication</a> in Pulsar enables you to do that.</p>

<h2 id="multi-tenancy">Multi-tenancy</h2>

<p>Pulsar was created from the ground up as a <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is multi-tenancy?" data-placement="top" data-content="TODO" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">multi-tenant</span> system. To support multi-tenancy, Pulsar has a concept of <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a property?" data-placement="top" data-content="TODO" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">properties</span>. Properties can be spread across <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a cluster?" data-placement="top" data-content="A set of Pulsar brokers and BookKeeper servers (aka bookies). Clusters can reside in different geographical regions and replicate messages to one another in a process called geo-replication." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">clusters</span> and can each have their own <a href="../../admin/Authz">authentication and authorization</a> scheme applied to them. They are also the administrative unit at which <a href="TODO">storage quotas</a>, <a href="TODO">message TTL</a>, and <a href="TODO">isolation policies</a> can be managed.</p>

<p>The multi-tenant nature of Pulsar is reflected mostly visibly in topic URLs, which have this structure:</p>

<p>As you can see, the property is the most basic unit of categorization for topics (and even more fundamental than the <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a cluster?" data-placement="top" data-content="A set of Pulsar brokers and BookKeeper servers (aka bookies). Clusters can reside in different geographical regions and replicate messages to one another in a process called geo-replication." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">cluster</span>).</p>

<h3 id="properties-and-namespaces">Properties and namespaces</h3>

<p>Pulsar was designed from the ground up to be a <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is multi-tenancy?" data-placement="top" data-content="TODO" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">multi-tenant</span> system. In Pulsar, <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a tenant?" data-placement="top" data-content="TODO" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">tenants</span> are identified by <a href="#properties">properties</a>. Properties are the highest administrative unit within a Pulsar <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a Pulsar instance?" data-placement="top" data-content="A group of Pulsar clusters that act together as a single unit." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">instance</span>. Within properties</p>

<h3 id="properties">Properties</h3>

<p>To each property in a Pulsar instance you can assign:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An <a href="../../admin/Authz#authorization">authorization</a> scheme</li>
  <li>The set of <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a cluster?" data-placement="top" data-content="A set of Pulsar brokers and BookKeeper servers (aka bookies). Clusters can reside in different geographical regions and replicate messages to one another in a process called geo-replication." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">clusters</span> to which the property applies</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="namespaces">Namespaces</h3>

<p><span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a property?" data-placement="top" data-content="TODO" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">Properties</span> and <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a namespace?" data-placement="top" data-content="TODO" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">namespaces</span> are two key concepts of Pulsar to support <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is multi-tenancy?" data-placement="top" data-content="TODO" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">multi-tenancy</span>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>A <strong>property</strong> identifies a <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a tenant?" data-placement="top" data-content="TODO" data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">tenant</span>. Pulsar is provisioned for a specified property with appropriate capacity allocated to the property.</li>
  <li>A <strong>namespace</strong> is the administrative unit nomenclature within a property. The configuration policies set on a namespace apply to all the topics created in such namespace. A property may create multiple namespaces via self-administration using REST API and CLI tools. For instance, a property with different applications can create a separate namespace for each application.</li>
</ul>

<p>Names for topics in the same namespace will look like this:</p>

<p>Pulsar supports a pluggable <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/blob/master/docs/Authentication.md">authentication</a> mechanism which can be configured at broker and it also supports <a href="https://github.com/apache/incubator-pulsar/blob/master/docs/Authorization.md">authorization</a> to identify client and its access rights on topics and properties.</p>

<h2 id="client-interface">Client interface</h2>

<p>Pulsar exposes a client API with language bindings for <a href="../../applications/JavaClient">Java</a> and <a href="../../applications/CppClient">C++</a>.

  </div>
</div>

<h3 id="client-setup-phase">Client setup phase</h3>

<p>When an application wants to create a producer/consumer, the Pulsar client library will initiate a setup phase that is composed of two steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The client will attempt to determine the owner of the topic by sending an HTTP lookup request to the <span class="popover-term" tabindex="0" title="What is a broker?" data-placement="top" data-content="A stateless component of Pulsar clusters that runs two other components: an HTTP server exposing a REST interface for administration and topic lookup and a dispatcher that handles all message transers. Pulsar clusters typically consist of multiple brokers." data-toggle="popover" data-trigger="focus">broker</span>. The request could reach one of the active brokers which, by looking at the (cached) zookeeper metadata will know who is serving the topic or, in case nobody is serving it, will try to assign it to the least loaded broker.</li>
  <li>Once the client library has the broker address, it will create a TCP connection (or reuse an existing connection from the pool) and authenticate it. Within this connection, client and broker exchange binary commands from a custom protocol. At this point the client will send a command to create producer/consumer to the broker, which will comply after having validated the authorization policy.</li>
</ol>

<p>Whenever the TCP connection breaks, the client will immediately re-initiate this setup phase and will keep trying with exponential backoff to re-establish the producer or consumer until the operation succeeds.</p>
